# Scripts-for-Noobs-like-Me
Scripts that were useful for a noob like me

Welcome to the club! This repo is built for anyone who ever got stuck trying to fix something or make something using scripts. If your a noob like me or just appreciate usable code, you might find this collection useful.

What's Inside

A hopefully growing collection of simple scripts, organized by type:

 - **Powershell** - Work in progress
 - Python - eventually
 - Batch - eventually
 - Bash - eventually
