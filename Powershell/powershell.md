## How to Use Powershell Scripts with Functions

Some Powershell scripts contain resusable functions. To use one:

1. **Run Powerhsell as Administrator**
2. **Dot-source the script** to load the function: . .\script.ps1
*(Note: There are two dots with a space between them.)*
3. **Call the function** with/without relevant parameters/values
